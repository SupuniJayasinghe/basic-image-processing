# Basic Image Processing

This repository contains implementations of basic image processing operations using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy. These tasks were completed as part of the EC7212 ‚Äì Computer Vision and Image Processing course.

## üß† Tasks Overview

### 1. **Reduce Intensity Levels (Quantization)**
Reduces the number of grayscale intensity levels in an image from 256 to a user-defined number that is a power of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 256).

- Input: Grayscale image
- Output: Posterized image with reduced levels
- Example: 256 levels ‚Üí 4 levels ‚Üí Output has pixel values like 0, 64, 128, 192

### 2. **Spatial Averaging (Smoothing)**
Performs spatial filtering (blurring) using averaging kernels:
- 3√ó3
- 10√ó10
- 20√ó20

Effect: Smoothens the image and reduces local intensity variations.

### 3. **Image Rotation**
Rotates the input grayscale image by:
- 45 degrees using affine transformation
- 90 degrees using built-in OpenCV rotation

### 4. **Block-wise Resolution Reduction**
Simulates resolution reduction by averaging non-overlapping blocks of:
- 3√ó3
- 5√ó5
- 7√ó7

All pixels within a block are replaced with the average intensity of the block, producing a pixelated effect.
